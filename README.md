# Exploring Hacker News Posts

A data analysis project to practice:
- Using loops, 
- Cleaning strings, and 
- Working with dates in Python.

In this project, I worked with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

The data set source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).

The analysis focuses on exploring posts whose titles begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.
